# structure-test-examples

This repo contains a basic example of using the [GCP Structure Tests](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/runtimes-common/tree/master/structure_tests)

To use, first run the `setup.sh` script to retrieve the correct binary, add to your system path, and pull the test image. Then, run the `run.sh` script in the `python` directory to run example tests on the Google App Engine Python image.

At this time, these tests will not run on Windows.
